👋 Hello, I'm Daniel Rodrigues, a Back-End Developer based in São Paulo, Brazil. I'm currently studying Multiplatform Software Development at Fatec Itaquera and I'm passionate about algorithms, programming and data structures in Python, JavaScript, C and C#. I have practical experience in projects involving Django, Express and React, and I am currently exploring the wonders of FastAPI.

🚀 I am committed to continuous learning and am expanding my knowledge of Data Analysis through the Google Career Certificates program, where I am exploring spreadsheets, SQL, R programming and Tableau.
